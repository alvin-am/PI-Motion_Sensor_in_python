Raspberry Pi PIR Sensor Hardware Setup
We will be putting together a simple circuit that makes use of a PIR sensor and also a piezo speaker.

A PIR sensor is most commonly seen in security systems to detect movement before sending the alarm off. They detect motion whenever there is a change of infrared temperature in their field of view.

Most PIR sensors have some adjustable screws on them that will allow you to adjust both the time and sensitivity of them. The time will allow you to set a delay before it goes off (Send a high signal). (About two to four seconds). The sensitivity is how much movement needs to occur before it goes off.

The piezo buzzer is a simple speaker that outputs a sound whenever a current is traveling through it. In this circuit, the buzzer will give a loud beep whenever the motion detector circuit is triggered.

A breadboard isn’t necessarily a requirement for this project, but I would highly recommend using one. A breadboard makes prototyping and building circuitry a lot easier.

You don’t have to use a breadboard like I am you can simply hook these straight up to the Raspberry Pi
